#PrimTree
My high school math research project on graph theory, made in several hours

##What it is
Procedurally generates an undirected graph using Python Turtle, then maps the graph's minimum spanning tree onto it.
Uses Prim's Algorithm to evaluate the MST.

######Comments
Code still messy, all in one file (WIP)
